Homework 3 Initial Submission

**About My Work
**

This is a simple user onboarding setup. It tells the user about a new app, lets them create a login, and then has them select hobbies they want to talk about. 

**What I Made
**

The first few tabs of the app tell the user about an app called Coffee Chat. It tells them that it'll connect them to other users with similar hobbies. After a few tabs of explanation, it takes the user to a "create an account" page. Once the user creates an account, they are then directed to a page where they can select the hobbies they want to talk to others about. I'd like to go further with this in the future and make it so that users can select multiple hobbies. After they select the hobbies, I'd like to make it so that they go to a page to make their profile. After finishing their profile setup (location, about me, interests, etc), it'll take them to connect with other relevant individuals in their area. 

**About the Layout
**

Background: Used images for most background and used the opacity feature to ensure it didn't distract from the foreground. In future iterations, I'd like to add short videos in the background as well/
Variables: created state variables to keep track of which view it is on (onboarding, hobby, etc)
Button/Tabs: Tabs are used for the initial navigation, then a button is used to get to login and buttons are used for the user to select the hobbies they're interested in. 


**My Thoughts**

I tried to apply the elements of UX design mentioned in class. I limited the number of font sizes I used, and tried to keep button in the same places. I believe the app is simple and relatively intuitive. For future iterations, I'd like to implement other parts of the principles of good UI design (reversibility, error prevention, hierarchy, feedback/responsiveness, etc).
